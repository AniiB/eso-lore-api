Time to go back to school. And when you do take this dictionary with you!

## Tech used: HTML | CSS | Vanilla JS

An API project. My learning was focused on fetching data from an API and then use it to manipulate the DOM.

## Optimizations

Optimizations I'd like to add in the future

-List of words previously searched saved as a shortcut for the user.

-Using localstorage to keep the search query list saved on return.


## Lessons Learned:

Learned how to navigate through multi-dimensional arrays and objects. Learned how to append data from an API to a dynamically generated table.
